# Coding

## Surface Confusion Early
- State assumptions before writing code. If uncertain, ask.
- When multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If requirements are ambiguous, stop and clarify. Don't guess.

## Write Less Code
- Solve exactly what was asked. No speculative features.
- Don't abstract what's used once. Three similar lines beat a premature helper.
- Don't add error handling for scenarios that can't happen.

## Change Only What You Must
- Don't improve adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor what isn't broken. Match existing style.
- If you notice unrelated problems, mention them — don't fix them.

## Prove It Works
- Write or run tests before calling it done.
- After two failed fix attempts, stop. Re-read the error, reconsider the approach.
- Check security basics: no hardcoded secrets, no unvalidated input.

## Plan, Execute, Verify
Transform tasks into verifiable outcomes. For multi-step work, state the plan up front.
